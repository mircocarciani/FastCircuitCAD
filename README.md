| C   | Capacitor             |
| L   | Inductor              |
| D   | Diode                 |
| Z   | Zener-Diode           |
| Q   | NPN Mosfet            |
| T   | Tranformer            |
| M   | Common Mode Choke     |
| F   | Fuse                  |
| B   | Full Bridge Rectifier |
| G   | Ground Connector      |
| P   | Pin Connector         |

When a new component is added, it is automatically placed in the center of the canvas.

## Move components
Components can be individually selected by a left mouse click on the component.
The current selection is hihglighted in red. Once the component is selected it can be moved around the canvas by a drag and drop action.
